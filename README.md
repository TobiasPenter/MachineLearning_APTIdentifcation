# Levaraging Machine Learning to Identify Active APTs in a Network

## About this Project
The aim of this project is to create a pair of machine learning models: one of thes models will be used to identify the type of malicious activity going on in the network and the other will be used to identify the most likely APT groups to be responsible for this activity. My hope is that this software could then be used by CTI analysts to pinpoint where the best areas for them to research would be and create more usefull rules for a SOC team to respond to which will help lower analyst and alert fatigue within both teams.
